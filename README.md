# Storing Credentials

The [store-credentials.ps1] (./store-credentials.ps1) script is an example of taking a plain text password and storing it as cipher text on a local system. You can use this to store credentials for tasks on a machine without leaving them behind in plain text for people to see or systems to scrape.
